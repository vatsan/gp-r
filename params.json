Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS abalone_array;\r\nCREATE TABLE abalone_array AS \r\nSELECT \r\n\tarray_agg(sex)::text[] as sex, \r\n\tarray_agg(length)::float8[] as length,\r\n\tarray_agg(diameter)::float8[] as diameter, \r\n\tarray_agg(height)::float8[] as height,\r\n\tarray_agg(whole_weight)::float8[] as whole_weight, \r\n\tarray_agg(shucked_weight)::float8[] as shucked_weight,\r\n\tarray_agg(viscera_weight)::float8[] as viscera_weight, \r\n\tarray_agg(shell_weight)::float8[] as shell_weight, \r\n\tarray_agg(rings)::float8[] as rings\r\nFROM abalone\r\nDISTRIBUTED RANDOMLY;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n```splus\r\nm = lm(formula = rings ~ ., data = abalone)\r\n\r\nx = readLines(pipe(\"pbpaste\"))\r\ny = table(x)\r\nbarplot( y[order( as.integer(rownames(y)) )], xlab='Segment ID', \r\n\t\t ylab='Number of rows', main = 'Row distribution across segments' )\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis document is a project by Woo Jung (@wjjung317) and Noah Zimmerman (@zimmeee)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
